lab 1 question

1) Modify the program to count the number of unique words in the text.
2) Add a function to find the longest word in the text.
3) Implement a feature to count the occurrences of a specific word (case-insensitive).
4) Create a function to calculate the percentage of words that are longer than the average word length.

labe 2 question

1) What are the advantages and disadvantages of the recursive approach compared to the iterative approach?
2) How does memoization improve the performance of the recursive function? Are there any drawbacks?
3) In what scenarios might you prefer to use a generator function over other implementations?
4) How does the space complexity differ between these implementations?
