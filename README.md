Unique Word Count:

The count_unique_words function removes punctuation, converts text to lowercase, and counts the number of unique words in the text.
Longest Word:

The Longest_words function finds the longest word in the text after removing punctuation and converting to lowercase.
Word Occurrence Counter:

The count_word_occurrences function counts how many times a specific target word appears in the text, ignoring case and punctuation.
